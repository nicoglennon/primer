# How to Get Started

Enough theory, how do you actually get started with this? Here's my suggestion.

### Buy ETH

Buy a small amount of ETH on [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/), [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en), or [Gemini](https://www.gemini.com/). To start, I'd recommend buying somewhere between $300 - $3,000 (0.1- 1 ETH), anything less might not be enough to explore.

These three services (Coinbase/Binance/Gemini) are called CEXes (centralized exchanges). This is where you turn your dollars into crypto and vice-versa, but now you want to move the money to a wallet you actually have the private key to.

### Create an Ethereum Wallet

Download [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/), which is by far the best Ethereum wallet (I also happen to work there). Create a new wallet in the app, and when asked to back up your wallet, remember to write down the seed phrase and store it somewhere safe! This is your private key â€” only you are in control of this wallet, unlike your CEX wallet.

Send the Ethereum that you bought in Coinbase/Binance/Gemini to your Rainbow wallet by copying the address from your Rainbow wallet and using that as the `to` address when sending. I I usually start by sending a small amount and once confirmed it arrived, I send the rest.

### Get an NFT

There are many places to explore NFTs but my favorites are [Zora](http://zora.co), [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) and [Foundation](https://foundation.app/). (If we're friends, just message me and I will send you one for free!)

### Get some tokens

Uniswap has thousands and thousands of tokens available to purchase. From Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) to tokenized ultra-rare unicorn socks (SOCKS), the possibilities are endless. (Again, if we're friends just message me and I will send you some, gratis!)

### Get an ENS domain

An ENS domain is an NFT that acts as your Ethereum username. Instead of sharing your long and convoluted wallet address, you can purchase a .eth domain like `example.eth` and use that as your public address instead. This is the Ethereum equivalent of buying a .com domain and using `example.com` instead of giving people a long and convoluted IP address. You can purchase an ENS domain at [ens.domains](http://ens.domains).
